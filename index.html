Why?
• PPTX sucks
• LATEX sucks
• PDF sucks

also:
terminal presentations
don't support images…

this text will not be displayed, since the @ at the start of the first line
makes this paragraph an image slide.

Why?

get your point across fast

simple to use

▸ one slide per paragraph
▸ lines starting with # are ignored
▸ image slide: paragraph containing @FILENAME
▸ empty slide: just use a \ as a paragraph


built-in editor
⇒press escape

depends on
♽ HTML5
☢ CSS3
☃ JavaScript

usage:
\ 
<meta charset="utf-8">
<script src="sent.js">
slide 1
\ 
slide 2
\ 
etc
<\/script>

one slide per paragraph

lines starting with # are ignored

image slide == paragraph containing @URL

empty slide == just use a \\ as a paragraph

Use \\<space> for a blank line in a slide

# This is a comment and will not be part of the presentation

# multiple empty lines between paragraphs are also ignored
